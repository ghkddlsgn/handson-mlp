Information about architecture config:
Tuple is structured by and signifies a convolutional block (filters, kernel_size, stride) 
Every convolutional layer is a same convolution. 
List is structured by "B" indicating a residual block followed by the number of repeats. 
"S" is for a scale prediction block and computing the yolo loss
"U" is for upsampling the feature map
